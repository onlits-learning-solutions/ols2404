 Structure
 
 struct student

 	int id;
 	char name[50];
 };
 
 int main(void)

 }
 
 si = (p * r * t)/100

 int a;
 float f;
 int a[10];
 
 date:	day/month/year
 time:	hour:minute:second
 
 date cd, dob;
 age = cd - dob;
 
 time dt, at;
 stoppage = dt - at
 
 A collection of related data (maybe dissimilar type)
 
 WAP to add two integers using pointer.
 
 
 Technically:
 
 Class is user-defined data-type	-	Schema/Description 	- Recipe
 Object is variable of class-type	-	Entity				- Samosa
 
 
 Objects are basic runtime entities in an object oriented sytem.
 	Objects:
 		Book
 		Member
 		Book Issue
 		Book Return
 		
 1. Encapsulation: The wrapping up of data and function into a single
 				   unit (called class). 
 				   
 				   
 				   
 class book
 {
 	int id;
 	string title;
 	
 public:
 	void newbook()
 	{
 	
 	}
 };
 
 int main(void)
 {
 	book b;
 	b.id = 1;		//error
 	b.newbook();
 }
